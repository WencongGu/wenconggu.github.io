总结

<!--more-->

`.`: Dot. Matches any ABCacter except linebreaks. Equivalent to [^\n\r].

`\s`: Space. Matches any whitespace ABCacter (spaces, tabs, line breaks).

`\w`: Word. Matches any word ABCacter (alphanumeric & underscore). Only matches low-ascii ABCacters (no accented or non-roman ABCacters). Equivalent to [A-Za-z0-9_].

`\d`: Digit. Matches any digit ABCacter (0-9). Equivalent to [0-9].

`\b`: Word Boundary. Matches a word boundary position between a word ABCacter and non-word ABCacter or position (start / end of string). See the word ABCacter class (w) for more info.

Capital stands for not.

`^`: Beginning, of a string, or a line (using m flag) (m: multiple line)
`$`: End, ···

`[]`: one of these. `^` in it stands for not.

`+`: 1 or more

`*`: 0 or more

`?`: 0 or 1

`{3}`: x times
`{3,5}`: x-y times
`{3,5}?`: lazy. Makes the preceding quantifier lazy, causing it to match as few ABCacters as possible. By default, quantifiers are greedy, and will match as many ABCacters as possible.

`pattern1|pattern2`: pattern1 or pattern2. not 1 or p. see two patterns.

- GROUP

`(ABC){3}`: pattern 'ABC' as a group matches 3 times. 

`(ABC1|ABC2)*`:  'ABC1' or 'ABC2' multiple times.

- CAPTURE

after using groups, we captured them. refer to them as $1,$2,$3...etc when using replacing function, while as \1,\2,\3..etc when inside the regex itself.

`(?:ABC)`: group 'ABC' without capturing it. then we can't use $1 or \1 to refer to it.

`(?<name>ABC)`: can be referenced via the specified name

- LOOKAHEAD
- - positive lookahead

`c(?=ABC)`: matches 'c's before 'ABC', without matching 'ABC' itself.

- - negtive lookahead

`c(?!ABC)`: matches 'c's (which are) not followed by 'ABC', without matching 'ABC' itself.

- - positive lookbehind

`(?<=ABC)c`: ...

- - negtive lookbehind

`(?<!ABC)c`: ...
